# My-Workday-Scheduler

A simple daily planner app for scheduling your work day.

# Description
The Work Day Scheduler is a web application designed to help employees manage their time effectively. It allows users to create a schedule for standard business hours (9 am to 5 pm), color-coded based on whether the time block is in the past, present, or future. Users can enter events for each hour, and the entered events persist even after refreshing the page, thanks to local storage.
